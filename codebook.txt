Introduction
The data presented in the dataset below are extracted from UCI "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset".  The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  It contains data derived from six activities WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).   
 The sensor signals obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope were preprocessed.  In the original dataset, the data were classified into X, Y, Z axis with various summarization such as mean, standard deviation, medium absolute deviation, minimum, maximum, entropy, energy etc., totaling 561 features.

Summarization
This project is to combine the original training and test data into one and extract only those columns containing the mean and standard deviation. This totals 79 columns. An extra column subject is added in order to associate the activity with a particular person.  Thus the subject column has value from 1 to 30 representing the 30 different volunteers.   The rest of the features reading (79 columns) are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].


Column definitions:
The column names are tidied up.  All non-alpha characters are removed.   However camel case is maintained and MEAN and STD are capitalized for easier readability.  These column names are given below.

Two processed datasets are derived: tidydetail.csv, tidymean.csv.   They contain the same set of features (80 columns).  Tidydetail.csv contains all the vector features obtained, ranging from 280 to 480+ rows per person   Tidymean.csv contains the mean all the column per person - one record per person, totally 30 rows in this file.
